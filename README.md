# My Blogs
I’ve long considered myself to be a geek dating back to my first computer, a Commodore 64 at the age of 11.
Since then, I’ve been hooked on technology in general.
While working on my undergraduate, I was lucky enough to have a professor that worked for IBM as one of their lead engineers on the eastern US coast for 30+ years.
He was teaching because he had retired from IBM, was bored, and enjoyed sharing his knowledge and experiences with perspective students.
It was his passion and drive that inspired to pass on my knowledge and skills as I acquire them.

So, with all of that said, this repository contains all my blog posts/technical writings that I’ve done through out my career.
It’s a source of truth and a collaboration point for me as I work through my thoughts and ideas while also attempting to have some of work peer reviewed when possible.

I use this repository in a [GitHub flow][github-flow] fashion to create content that I want to publish to various forums.
The integration into `main` via pull requests is to aid in having the content peer reviewed by others.
